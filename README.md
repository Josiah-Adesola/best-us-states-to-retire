# DATA TRANSFORMATION

I scrapped the data from the website above. I performed data transformation with Power Query on POWER BI, I extracted it with the POwer Query, selected only table, then promoted headers. The table was a clean data, there wasn't much transformation.

I used PowerBI for  visualization. It was an awesome process, I visualized the top crime states, extreme weather conditions, best states and affordable states.
